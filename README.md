# NBA-Salaries-Linear-Regression

Using stats from [Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/) I will look at players and use statistical categories like points, age and steals as features to map players to an expected salary or worth.

This will help realize franchises which players are under or over achieving within their team to give them ideas of who to trade for to make their team better.  Most importantly, using these predictions, general managers will have a salary in mind for which players to target and how much their fair market value will be based on comparable salary for statistically similar players around the league.  These predictions will then be used to rank or discuss top players for the 2021 free agency market.
